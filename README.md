# Gas-Filling-Station

COATING TO MAKE THE GAS FILLING STATION EASY USING CRM  

1. Project Overview: 

“This project is a comprehensive ‘Gas Station Management’, built from the ground upon  Salesforce platform.” Its primary objective is to solve key functional challenges in fuel retail. It replaces fragmented, manual tracking methods with a single and centralized source of truth. This model enables the app's most critical feature: a real-time stock formula. The formula automatically calculates available stock in each station by using Roll-Up Summaries. The team built a custom Lightning App and Page Layouts to support staff. They also designed a granular protection model using Profiles and Roles to secure data. The application's logic is further enhanced by advanced automation and proof. A Salesforce Flow automatically sends email receipts to customers, improving service, while Apex Triggers protect data unity by preventing invalid entries (like a low price) or actual deletions of major supply records

 2. Intro :

 This"GasFilling Station Management" project outlines. The creation of a comprehensive, end-to-end application on the Salesforce platform. Designed to replace manual, fragmented processes. This app solves key operational challenges. By creating a single, secure source of truth for all supplier, inventory, and sales data. Key features include a real-time inventory formula. 
A granular model of Profiles and Roles secures the entire system. The system aggregates all data into a final Report and Dashboard. These tools provide managers with actionable insights to optimize their business. The app’s data model uses a junction object (Fuel Details) to create a many-to-many relationship. This object links individual Suppliers to Gas Stations and tracks each fuel delivery. The team built a custom Lightning App (“GAS STATION 7”). It also provide users with a single workspace. They also designed custom Page Layouts, such as the “customer layout". To organize fields logically.These changes make staff tasks faster and more efficient. 


 3 . Project Overview :

The team built the application on a custom data model, using a junction object to link Suppliers and Gas Stations.. It features a core real-time inventory formula (Fuel Supplied - Fuel Sold) powered by Roll-Up Summary fields. The system includes a custom Lightning App for staff, a Flow to automate customer email receipts, and Apex Triggers to enforce advanced data validation. The project culminates in a Report and Dashboard, which aggregates all sales and inventory data to provide managers with actionable, real-time business insights.


 4. Objectives 

The team built a custom data model to track the entire supply chain. Fuel Details serve as a junction object linking Suppliers and Gas Stations.

The app's core logic is a real-time inventory figuring using Roll-Up and Formula fields. It is  automatically compute (Total Fuel Supplied) - (Total Fuel Sold). 

The team configured a complete security model using Profiles, Roles, and OWD. This setup ensures that Managers and Sales Persons have the correct level of data access. 

The project's final deliverable is an analytics dashboard. That gives managers a real-time visual summary of sales and stock, enabling data-driven decisions. 

5. Execution Modules 

 5.1 Requirements and Planning  

Understand what the gas station management system needs to do, like recording fuel deliveries. The managing supplier and buyer information, tracking fuel stock, and sending automated alerts. 
Plan how to organize data and what features are essential. Using custom objects like Supplier, Gas Station, Buyer, and Fuel details.
 
5.2 Salesforce Development – Backend and Configuration

●  Custom Objects/Fields: Create custom objects like Supplier, Gas Station, Buyer, Fuel details, and fields. For things like Fuel supplied, Fuel price/liter, and Amount Paid.

●  Automate Tools:  Use Salesforce tools (like Flow) to automate tasks . Tasks such as sending an email receipt to a Buyer after a record is created.

●  Valid Rule Config: Set rules to prevent data entry mistakes. Eg (like using REGEX to ensure the Phone Number on the Buyer object ). 

● Apex Triggers: Write code that runs when records are changed. Eg(e.g., before delete on Fuel details to prevent deleting records with Fuel supplied > 500. Or before insert on Gas Station to ensure Fuel price/liter is above 50).


 5.3 UI/UX Development : 

          ● App Creation: Build the main "GAS STATION 7"  for easy access to all supply.

          ● Tabs: Add tabs for quick sailing (e.g., Suppliers, Gas Stations, Buyers, Fuel details). 

          ●  Page Layouts: Design custom forms like the "customerlayout"for theBuyer object. Organized sections for "Personal details" and "Receipt details." 


5.4 Testing of Flows, Triggers, Approval Process

 ● Check that all automations, codes, and approval setups work correctly by testing different scenarios. 

● Creating a Fuel details record and checking that the Roll-Up Summary fields on Supplier. 

● The user creates a new Buyer record and confirms that the automated email Flow.

● Trying to delete a Fuel details record with Fuel supplied > 500.


5.5 Development and Maintenance
  
● Salesforce Flow for Email Alerts: Set up a Record-Triggered Flow.It's automatically send a receipt email. Email to the Buyer with their transaction details. Apex Triggers maintain data integrity by automatically notifying users. In an error message whenever a problem occurs, such as a low price or deletion of a protected record.


 5.6 Outputs and Screenshots  

● Show results of the system, such as the measured Roll-Up Summary fields on a Supplier record, the final Amount Paid formula on a Buyer record, and the  email presented. Include screenshots to display the final "Estimate amount" Dashboard, the "Amount range" Report with formatting, and the custom "customer layout" page.

The business impact of this Gas Station Management app is a significant increase in operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making. By leveraging a custom data model, the app provides real-time stock management (using the Fuel Available formula) and a single source of truth for all supplier, station, and buyer data. Automation through Salesforce Flow (for email receipts) and robust data protection via Apex Triggers and Validation Rules (to block bad data) work together to enhance customer service and ensure high data integrity. The system tracks key metrics to measure success, including improved Inventory Accuracy, fewer Stock-out Events, a lower Data Entry Error Rate, and instant availability of sales analytics on the Manager's Dashboard. The application allows managers to track supplier performance using real-time data. By using the "Sum of Fuel Supplied" Roll-Up Summary, the business can now instantly see which suppliers are their most important partners, providing powerful data for negotiating better contracts. The security model (using Profiles, Roles, and OWD) is a key business feature. The system restricts reports to the Manager role, while allowing Sales Persons to access only the data they need for their job.
